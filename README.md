#Analysis of Anonymous Algorithms - CSC 625 Project 2
#Overview

This project is an in-depth analysis of multiple anonymous algorithms, exploring their run-time complexities, implementations, and practical applications. The project encompasses:

    Run-time Analysis: Utilizing techniques discussed in class to analyze best and worst-case scenarios.
    Prediction: Estimating run-time for varying problem sizes to design comprehensive test cases.
    Implementation: Developing the algorithms using Python.
    Testing: Measuring run-time across different problem sizes to obtain empirical data.
    Comparison: Evaluating measured versus predicted run-time and explaining any discrepancies.
    Understanding: Determining the functionality and significance of each algorithm.

Algorithm Characteristics

    Arrays: A, B, C, D, E are integer arrays indexed from 1.
    Integers: Variables i, j, k, l, m, n, p, q, r represent integer values.
    Size: N denotes the initial array size.
    Value Range: Elements in the initial array are integers within a defined range.
