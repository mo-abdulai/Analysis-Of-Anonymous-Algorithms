CSC 625 Analysis of Algorithms - Project 2: Analysis of Anonymous Algorithms
Project Overview
This project delves into the analysis of various anonymous algorithms written in pseudo-code. The primary objectives are:

    Analysis: Analyze the run time (best case and worst case) using techniques discussed in class.
    Predictions: Estimate run time for different problem sizes to design test cases.
    Implementation: Implement the algorithms in Python.
    Testing: Measure running time for various problem sizes to obtain reliable results.
    Comparison: Compare the measured run time to predicted run time and explain discrepancies.
    Understanding: Determine the purpose and process of each algorithm.

Algorithms Definitions and Descriptions
General Information

    Arrays: Variables A, B, C, D, E are arrays of integers indexed from 1.
    Integers: Variables i, j, k, l, m, n, p, q, r are integers.
    Size: N represents the size of the initial array.
    Range: All elements in the initial array are integers within a specific range.

Algorithms Overview

    Algorithm 1: Utilizes general descriptions.
    Algorithm 2: Uses an array of linked lists (Z).
    Algorithm 3: Incorporates random number generation.
    Algorithm 4: Uses the random_between(p, r) function.
    Algorithm 5: Focuses on array manipulation.
    Algorithm 6: Requires calling to Algorithm6(A, 1, N).
    Algorithm 7: Uses array A and size N.
    Algorithm 8: Yet to be defined.
